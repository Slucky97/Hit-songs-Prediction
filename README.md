# Hit-songs-Prediction
In this project, I tried to use machine learning/Deep Learning models to try to predict hit songs using features extracted from spectrograms and Spotify API

First, you need if you want to create your own playlist, you can create it on your spotify account or use the spotify playlists
I used. Here are the ID : Most streamed playlist : 6nQbyuthivfdNSvc2m9zAi, Least stramed playlist : 6Ej78Wlqm4NlwWLApZRzTB

-----------------------------------------If you want to create your own dataset----------------------------------------------

You will also need to create a spotify API account. Follow this tutorial : https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started

You will need to create youtube API account. There are plenty tutorials on the internet

-----------------------------------------If you want to test the project with my dataset-------------------------------------
You just have to use the dataset.ms_ls which is the final csv file used for the Spotify API features

You can test my model or test any machine learning model you want with the different spectrograms
